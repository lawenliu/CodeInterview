Ways to approach a general Design approach:
1. Use Cases Genereation: Gether all the possible use cases.
2. Constraints and Analysis: How many users, how much data etc.
3. Basic Design: Most basic design. Few users case.
4. Bottlenecks: Find the bottlenecks and solve them.
5. Scalability: A large number of users. 4 and 5 steps will go in loop till we get a satisfactory answer.
