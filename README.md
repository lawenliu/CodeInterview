--------------
Some tips about interview. It is important for you to know something about the interview key value.
### CV/Resume
You should write a perfect resume to pass the filter of HR and get a chance for interview. It is important to know something about the company and position you are applying. Writing some related working experiences on your resume could help you get more chance to get the interview. You can also add some reward information etc.
Make sure your resume is clear and orgnized so that HR or interviewer can easily get what you have done before based on your resume.
Make sure you know everything well on your resume. If interviewer ask any questions related with your resume, you should answer without consideration.
### Interview
* Ask clarifying questions if you don't understand the problems or need more information. Some interviewer want to communicate with you to check your perception for a problem. So they will only give you the main question without limitations and corner check requirements. You need ask to give more information about the question. If you don't get more information, and you want to do hypothesis, you need talk with interviewer and make sure they agree with you.
* Explain your thoughts about the questions before you start to code. This is important step. I think there are two points. First, the time from you start coding to you finish, it may take at least 5 minute. Normally the interviewer could write some comments for you during this time. But they will feel nothing to do during this time, you are waste their time. Second, If you can talk with interview about your thoughts, you can get some feedback about the solution to avoid unexpected time wasting for you. And if they think you have a correct thought about the question, then you finished half of the question, they can write some feedback when you are coding. Some interviewer may check your code when you are writing the code. Indeed, you are saving time for yourself.
* Improve your solution. Most of time, we can't get the best performing solution including time and space. So we can come some easy solution first, such as brute-force. And then interviewer will ask for better solution, you can improve it better to better. Don't hang there for the best solution at beginning.
* Ask questions at the end of the interview. Prepare some good questions to ask interviewers will give you extra score. The question should make the interviewer easy to answer and let them feel proud.
